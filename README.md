# Sudoku Solver v1.1
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Personal project to practice Algorithm Design, Optimisation and Image Processing using Java.

# Get Started

To use the solver you can enter the Sudoku matrix yourself or can use the preferred method of editing the example matrix in the code. When entering the numbers for the input matrix keep in mind that it starts on the top left corner and ends at the bottom right. Inputs are taken from left to right and top to bottom. Blank to filled are marked as zeroes.


# Features
  - Shows the input matrix and analyzes the number of spaces that need computation
  - Shows the number of steps or recursive calls it took for solving a particular input matrix

# How to use?
This program requires a Java SDK to be available on the device you are trying it to run on. If such a device is not available you can always use the online compilers to run the code but full funcationality and bugless behaviour is not guaranteed. Some of the online compiler it works on are listed below:

## Future
As I continue to learn image processing techniques the future version of the Sudoku Solver will incorporate these image processing and recognition techniques in the form of scan and solve functionality.

Also, for now the program is CLI-based but future versions will have a GUI for easier input and operation.

## Development
Want to contribute or have more optimised approach? Great!
Just open an issue and I will take a look.
